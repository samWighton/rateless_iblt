The aim of this Rust Crate is to allow efficient set reconciliation over a network interface. This is acheived using Rateless Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (Rateless IBLT).

Based on the paper titled 'Practical Rateless Set Reconciliation' authored by Lei Yang, Yossi Gilad, Mohammad Alizadeh.

I intend to include additional functionality to help with cases where the sets are stored on disk.
